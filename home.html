<br/>Music chosen by participants is likely to vary in terms of its valence and arousal, as well as other musical properties known to predict affective responses to music. When participant-selected music is used researchers may gain increased ecological validity, but relinquish a degree of experimental control over the intervention stimulus. At the same time, previous experimental research has found that people have stronger and more positive responses to music which is self-chosen, even to high-arousal and negatively-valenced music, possibly due to increased preference, familiarity, and memories associated with the music. Thus, self-chosen music may be more suitable than experimenter-chosen music, especially if a stress or NA induction is employed.
